In python indexing starts with zero because it makes the code more readable and efficient.
If there are 5 objects in a list, for example list=[“a”,”b,”,”c”,”d”,”e”] then the indexing happens like 0 for a, 1 for b, 2 for c, 3 for d, 4 for e.
We use lists in python to store objects. Objects can be any type and we can store same type or different types of data in one list.
Real life examples for lists are Refrigerator, Travel bag etc.
