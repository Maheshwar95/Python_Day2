PEP8 is a document that provides various guidelines to write readable code in python. It describes how the developer can write beautiful code.
It was officially written in 2001 by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and Nick Coghlan.
PEP stands for “Python Enterprise Proposal”. 
The main aim of PEP is to enhance the readability and consistency of a python code.
Naming conventions, Indentations, Line breaks, opening and closing brackets , comments, inline comments etc comes under PEP 8.

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
Below are the python operators:
Arithmetic Operators:   + , - , *, / , % , ** , //
Assignment Operators:  = , += , -= , *= , /=, %= , //= , **= ,  &=, |= , ^= , >>= , <<=
Comparison Operators: == , != , > , < , >= , <= 
Logical Operators: and , or ,not
Identity Operators: is , is not
Membership Operators: in , not in
Bitwise Operators:  And(&) , OR(|) , XOR(^) , NOT(~) , Zero fill left shift(<<) , Signed right shift(>>)
For loop in python is used for iterating over a sequence(That is either a set, tuple, list, dictionary or a string)
For example:
 for i in range(4)
        Print(i)
Output:
              0
              1
              2
              3                   
Here ‘for’ is used for iterating, ‘i’ refers to index, ‘range’ is range of values up to the given value from zero.
