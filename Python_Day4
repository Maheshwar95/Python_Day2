In python we can give underscore before the variable names, but if we give any numbers or signs then we get syntax error.
There are two types of objects in python. They are Mutable and Immutable objects.
Mutable objects means they can be changed or replaced after they are created.
Example -  List , set, Dictionary, array
When we need to modify, add or remove the existing data mutable objects are useful. 
Immutable objects means they cannot be changed after they are created.
Example - Integer, float, boolean, string, tuple
When we need to keep the data consistent and unaltered by anyone then immutable objects are useful.
List is a collection of data, we can store multiple objects in one variable is known as list. Elements or values stored in list can be called as items.
In python, lists can be both homogeneous or heterogeneous .
Homogeneous means it contains only single type of data, where as heterogeneous means it contains multiple types of data.
We can add the item in the list using “.append”, item from the list can be removed by using “.pop or .remove” . We can also know the index of the item in the list using “.index”.
Example :
Nums=[1,”mango”]
Nums.append(“apple”)
Nums.remove(1)
     Or
Nums.pop(0)
Print(nums)
Print(nums.index(apple))
Here .pop is used to remove item in a particular index so we give index.
But in .remove we must give the item name that needs to be removed.
