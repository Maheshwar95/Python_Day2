Steps to add python file to our repository :
After creating the .py file we need to execute below commands.
@Maheshwar95 ➜ /workspaces/Python_Day2 (main) $ git add .
@Maheshwar95 ➜ /workspaces/Python_Day2 (main) $ git commit -m "added python extension file"
@Maheshwar95 ➜ /workspaces/Python_Day2 (main) $ git push

Time complexity in python is the amount of  time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input.

Different types of time complexity:

1.Constant Time complexity (Big O Notation) :
Time complexity is often expressed using Big O notation. It describes the upper bound of the time complexity, giving the worst-case scenario regarding time taken.
Below given example has a time complexity of O(1), meaning it will always execute in the same amount of time, regardless of the size of the input:
constant_time_complexity(arr):
    print(arr[0])

constant_time_complexity([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

2.Linear Time Complexity :
A function or algorithm is said to have a linear time complexity, O(n), when the execution time increases linearly with the size of the input data
linear_time_complexity(arr):
for i in arr:
print(i)

linear_time_complexity([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

3.Quadratic Time Complexity:
A function has a quadratic time complexity, O(n^2), when the time it takes to run the function is square of the size of the input:
quadratic_time_complexity(arr):
    for i in arr:
        for j in arr:
            print(i, j)

quadratic_time_complexity([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
