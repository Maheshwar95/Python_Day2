Time complexity in python is time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input.
Time complexity of a list is as follows:
Accessing an element by index >>  O(1)
Inserting or deleting an element at the end >>  O(1)
Inserting or deleting an element at the beginning or middle >>  O(n)
Searching for an element >>  O(n)
Sorting >>  O(n log n)
Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable, they are indicated with curly brackets { }
For example : Set = {1,2,3,a,b,c,â€¦..}
Set is a collection of data which is unordered, unchangeable, unindexed.
Time complexity of set in python is O(1)
